- Added networked hit sound effects for locomotion (HandHitProvider and HandHitFXV2 components).
- Added sound effects to buttons and other UI elements.
- Exposed RaycastHit (leftHandHitInfo and rightHandHitInfo) in the Player locomotion component.
- The player model's head now rotates on the X and Z axis (while Y rotates the whole body).
- Added a headOffset property to the Player locomotion component and improved the behavior of the component when the player rotates their head.
- Added the GameModeIsDisabled property to the InfectionGameMode component. It can be used to toggle the gamemode at runtime.
- A disabled InfectionGameMode component now applies GameModeIsDisabled=true on fresh models.

[1.4.0]
- Added the BannedUserManager component and the Playfab Banned scene. Users that are banned on Playfab now load that scene.
- Added the XR Device Test scene to help users debug their PCVR connection.
- Added the useStickyGrab property to the GrabbableObject component. When enabled, the object is only released when the release action is performed a second time.
- Fixed the behaviour of the grab system when two players grab the same object at the exact same time. A client who grabs an object now also requests exclusive ownership over the object's RealtimeView (in previous versions the client only requested non-exclusive ownership of the RealtimeTransform).
- Now using preventOwnershipTakeover inside the AutoDistributeOwnership component for smoother ownership changes.
- Added the AutoDistributeViewOwnership component, it's a simpler version of AutoDistributeOwnership. It only manages ownership of its view instead of a managing the ownership of a specific component.
